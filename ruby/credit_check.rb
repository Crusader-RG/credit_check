# Expected Output:
# If it is valid, print "The number is valid!"
# If it is invalid, print "The number is invalid!"

# Hints

# You don't need any kind of loops, iteration, or arrays (You can certainly use them, but they aren't required)
# You can pull a character out of a string using `my_string[X]` where `X` is a numeric position number
# You can convert a string to an integer by calling `.to_i` (ex: `"4".to_i`)
